    "title": "\ud83d\udd25 OpenAI's identity crisis and the battle for AI's future",
    "description": "I normally send my commentary to Premium members of Exponential View only. However, given the rapid developments, and the ripple-effects the events of this weekend may have for the ongoing debate on AI safety, I will keep this piece open to the public for the time-being.  it with anyone who wants to make sense of what the OpenAI's crisis means. \nBack in 2020, I had a \nlong conversation with Sam Altman\n about the role of OpenAI's board and how he thought governance of the organisation might change. Looking back, Sam's answers were prescient.\nAzeem Azhar\n: I'm curious about what you think a Global Compact [for AI], might look like in the next few years, where we feel we can get these technologies working for humanity, but in a way that is well-governed.\nSam Altman: \nIt's a super important question.\u00a0We can study history and see how that goes. When there is no public oversight, when you have these companies that are as powerful as, or more powerful than, most nations and are governed by unelected, and to be perfectly honest, fairly unaccountable leaders, I think that should give all of us pause as these technologies get more and more powerful.\nAnd I think we need to figure out some way not just that economics get shared and that we deal with the inequality problem that society is facing,\u00a0but the governance about these very big decisions. \nWhat do we want our future to look like in the world\u00a0with very powerful AI? That is not a decision that 150 people sitting in San Francisco make collectively. That's not going to be good.\nAzeem Azhar: \nI haven't found good models right now that do this. I think that people talk about the idea of minilateralism, which is that if you can just bring enough people to talk often enough, perhaps you create the kernel of a framework that other people can buy into, and then people copy that.\nSam Altman: \nYeah, I think that is helpful for sure. But then there is always a question of how much teeth does it really have?\nLet's say we really do create AGI. Right now, \nif I'm doing a bad job with that, our board of directors, which is also not publicly accountable, can fire me and say, 'Let's try somebody else'. But it feels to me like at that point, at some level of power, the world as a whole should be able to say, hey, maybe we need a new leader of this company, just like we are able to vote on the person who runs the country.\nAnd so, this question of what democratic process for companies that have sufficient impact looks like. I am very far from an expert here, and much smarter people than me have been thinking about it, but it occurs to me that we've got these models, and we can look at the different ones around the world and talk about some countries where it works better and where it doesn't work as well.\u00a0\nAnd now it has happened. Sam has been fired by the board. And Greg Brockman, the Chair and President, has also left the company. It's an evolving story. \nThe Information\n has \ngood coverage\n, so too does \nBloomberg\n. \nRon Conway\n, the most legendary of Silicon Valley angel investors, calls it 'a Board coup that we have not seen the likes of since 1985 when the then-Apple board pushed out Steve Jobs. It is shocking.'\nIt seems questions of the balance AI safety vs market momentum were factors in the decision. There may be other things in play. Altman has a lot of irons in the fire, including his cryptocurrency, WorldCoin; a fusion startup, Helion; explorations with Jonny Ive & Masa Son to create an AI device. Perhaps a new conflict of interest \u2014 even a direct competitor to OpenAI \u2014 was surfacing. \n\nIf we believe AI is a powerful general-purpose technology, then it is going to have massive impacts across society: printing press, electricity, steam engine, internet style effects. Not just to our productivity but to our cultures, communities and quotidian. \nIf that is the case, then we will really benefit from a widespread debate. Such a debate will involve friction, disagreement, and contestation - and important that it happens as transparently and publicly as possible.\u00a0\nOpenAI's crisis is like a terrarium for the wider debate about technology-in-society in general and AI in particular.\u00a0\nI don't want to hazard too many guesses, although much discussion seems to revolve around the strategic direction of the company and the balance of safety versus market momentum. How OpenAI - or any AI firm - approaches that question is really important. And an optimal approach is non-obvious. \nThere are many AI researchers who think about safety. OpenAI has a large safety team led by Ilya Sutskever. But it is important to realise that safety in AI in 2023 is not like safety in cars in 2023. When we think about safety in cars, the quality of airbags, and the efficacy of the brakes, these are known quantities. We have data for them. The CEOs who shirk vehicle safety can evaluate the risks\u2014the deaths and injuries \u2014when they make those decisions.\u00a0\nBut the AI safety debate in 2023 is not where the car safety debate is. There is insufficient data. There is no scientific agreement of what the risks look like. There isn't a standard toolkit to rely on. \nInstead, we have a series of interconnected processes: of scientific research; of social and institutional exploration (safety for whom, at what cost); and of product discovery (how does this actually manifest itself in the real world) which are feeling their way from a place where we have some answers to a frontier beyond our existing knowledge.\nHow should resources be allocated to each of these buckets? Where should we draw the line? Should we insist on having working, provable theories of safety that we then build against? Or does finding those theories, and more importantly, working models of safety, require putting products into the field, allowing for widespread experimentation and challenge and a constant updating of our theoretical understanding? And if the latter, what is the appropriate rate at which that should happen?\nThese aren't obvious questions. Because, as I said, we don't know.\nWe regularly use technologies whose mechanisms we don't understand and whose safety parameters are established empirically not theoretically. Anaesthetics are one great example of that. We have been using them since the 1840s, and even today while we finally have an incomplete understanding of how they impact receptors and neural pathways, we still establish their safe usage through trial-and-error. As someone who has had the odd anaesthetic, I'm quite pleased we didn't wait for a theoretical understanding of their safety before we let doctors get their surgical gloves on them.\u00a0\nThat isn't to say that we should career our way into AI development without paying heed to safety. \nIt's to say that addressing the question isn't straight-forward. \nIn my first \nconversation with Sam in 2020\n, he expresses how he believes for AI there needs to be a wider more democratic debate. And in a sense, that is what we are having with AI. And this is in sharp contrast to other technologies.\u00a0\nAll GPTs change everything. And having a quality debate about them is critical. Such a debate has many facets: the breadth of participation (including public participation), the consideration of different impacts, the long-term perspective, the evidence base used, the way it shaped policy outcomes, how timely it was and its adaptability and accountability.\u00a0\nWith previous widely applicable technologies and services, the breadth of this debate was variable or non-existent. Consider Uber's explosion into our cities.\u00a0Go further back in history: there was virtually no public awareness or debate around electricity or the roll-out of the steam engine or plastics.\nThe exploration of the impacts of genetic engineering was much more healthy than those technologies (or things like the Internet) but public engagement was simply not as deep as we are seeing in today's AI discussions.\u00a0\nBy contrast to the vast, fractal complex of discussion from governments to schools, in the media and in conferences, on Twitter and in research papers, the AI debate is very rich indeed.\u00a0\nWhat we are seeing is the start of widespread public consultation with broad participation of a wide range of groups, with wider discussion of many different impacts, and an increasingly adaptable approach to how we deal with this.\u00a0\nUsing this lens, the OpenAI fracas is just part of that process of contestation and norming. It's not a disaster. It's probably not even a hiccup. Perhaps it slows OpenAI down for a few months while they catch their breath and rethink priorities: research, engineering and commercial. Over the long dur\u00e9e, it's irrelevant: the know-how is in people's heads. We know something as good\u2014and limited\u2014as GPT-4 Turbo is possible. It isn't a high watermark to which we'll never be able to return. And given that this crisis probably comes with better governance long-term, it is probably a good thing. \n\nI have some simple principles that I like to apply: that concentration of power is unhelpful, that a diversity of actors is helpful, that monocultures are not resilient\u2026. in short, that more players is often better than fewer players.\nSo a schism in OpenAI which may give rise to people leaving and taking their knowledge with them is a good thing. \nTechnology is compounded knowledge and it benefits from the intersection of different worldviews and experiences. If researchers leave OpenAI and go elsewhere to create startups or to join competitors, that is a good thing.\u00a0\nWe're probably better off with \nDario\n, Daniela and Jack having left OpenAI in 2021 to found Anthropic than had they stayed there.\u00a0\nSo if Sam or Greg Brockman, OpenAI's former Chair and President who resigned yesterday, goes off and starts a new AI business, from the perspective of scientific research, technical progress and, yes, safe and transparent deployment, it is likely a net positive. And, it wouldn't be surprising if the either of them is soon involved in one or more than one projects that overlap or compete with OpenAI.\nIf this ouster spurs interest in other ways of organising and building AI infrastructure, from open-source to utility-style thinking to good-old-fashioned market competition, it's also a net positive. \nOne of the less salubrious aspects of\u00a0AI debate has been about the relative importance of governance of the technology. Many elements of Silicon Valley techno culture push back on the idea of governance (stick-it-to-the-man meets libertarian pioneerism), so it's not just ironic, it's emblematic, that OpenAI, the biggest thing to come out of the Valley in decades, has just had a huge governance failure.\u00a0\nGovernance does matter. As OpenAI exponentiated from a small research shop in 2015 to the thing it is today, the governance has simply not kept pace. OpenAI today has a sophisticated structure where this comparatively young board oversees a 501(c)(3) non-profit which owns a holding non-profit which is the majority owner of the capped profit company (in which Microsoft has invested). \nThis isn't to say that the board of OpenAI didn't have to act on Friday (perhaps they had to, perhaps they didn't). But it seems plausible that the Board was falling short - to ask tough questions and hold executives to account - in the months leading up to the crisis. The Board didn't have a whole lot of governance experience for a firm that was so much in the spotlight.\u00a0\nThis is uncharted territory for any organisation - and one key priority will be to strengthen OpenAI's governance and to clarify what its mission really is.\u00a0\nThe upheaval at OpenAI is not an isolated incident but rather a reflection of the broader challenges facing the industry as we grapple with the oversight of this transformative technology. I mean, Sam himself, highlighted that very thing to me in 2020.\u00a0\nNow might be the time to take this episode to heart and find a transparent system of governance as advanced and sophisticated as the AI it seeks to oversee.",

    "description": "PARIS - Ousted OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is welcome in France, France's digital minister said in a statement on X, a day after the board of the company behind ChatGPT fired Altman without giving a reason. \n\n\n\"Sam Altman, his team and their talents are welcome in France if they want to,\" Digital Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said in a statement on X on Saturday. \n\n\nIn May, during on a trip through European capitals for talks with political leaders, Altman met with French President Emmanuel Macron to discuss the place of France and Europe in the global race for artificial intelligence (AI).\n \nMicrosoft-backed OpenAI released its ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022. It uses generative AI meaning it can learn from past data to create new content including text, images and computer code. \n\n\nIn a video message to tech leaders on Friday, Macron said generative AI has huge potential and that France plans a conference about AI in Paris next year. \n\n\nHe added France had been an AI pioneer five years ago, with a dedicated strategy and a 1.5 billion euro budget.\n \nMacron said it is a \"civilisational challenge\" for France to make sure AI algorithms are not only fed English-language content. \n \n\"I want it to also reflect our French culture and language and our way of thinking,\" Macron said, adding France would open its databases to AI, while protecting copyright and ensuring adequate regulation. \n\n\nMacron also welcomed the launch this week of Kyutai, a non-profit AI research laboratory founded by French tech billionaire Xavier Niel, French CMA CGM shipping group chief Rodolphe Saade, and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. \n\n\nNiel's Iliad Group and CMA CGM have each contributed 100 million euros to Kyutai, which has total investments of nearly 300 million euros.\n\n\nAt the start of his first term in office, Macron pledged he would fight to prevent France from falling behind U.S. and Chinese tech giants, but five years later, no European firm is among the leaders in generative AI.

Brockman on Saturday (Nov 18) took to his official account on X and said that he and Sam are \"shocked and saddened\" by the way they were suddenly removed from the board and were \"still trying to figure out\" exactly what happened. \n \"Last night, Sam got a text from Ilya asking to talk at noon Friday.

Around the same time, OpenAI published a blog post,\" he stated. \n \"As far as we know, the management team was made aware of this shortly after, other than Mira (Murati) who found out the night prior,\" Brockman added.\nHe further said that the \"outpouring of support\" was really nice and that they would be okay. \n \"Greater things coming soon,\" he stated.

    "title": "ChatGPT-maker OpenAI fires CEO Sam Altman, the face of the AI boom, for lack of candor with company",
    "description": "(AP) - ChatGPT-maker Open AI said Friday it has pushed out its co-founder and CEO Sam Altman after a review found he was 'not consistently candid in his communications' with the board of directors.\n'The board no longer has confidence in his ability to continue leading OpenAI,' the artificial intelligence company said in a statement.\nIn the year since Altman catapulted ChatGPT to global fame, he has become Silicon Valley's sought-after voice on the promise and potential dangers of artificial intelligence and his sudden and mostly unexplained exit brought uncertainty to the industry's future.\nMira Murati, OpenAI's\u00a0\nchief technology officer\n, will take over as interim CEO effective immediately, the company said, while it searches for a permanent replacement.\nThe announcement also said another OpenAI co-founder and top executive, Greg Brockman, the board's chairman, would step down from that role but remain at the company, where he serves as president. But later on X, formerly Twitter, Brockman posted a message he sent to OpenAI employees in which he wrote, 'based on today's news, i quit.'\nIn another X post on Friday night, Brockman said Altman was asked to join a video meeting at noon Friday with the company's board members, minus Brockman, during which OpenAI co-founder and Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever informed Altman he was being fired.\n'Sam and I are shocked and saddened by what the board did today,' Brockman wrote, adding that he was informed of his removal from the board in a separate call with Sutskever a short time later.\nOpenAI declined to answer questions on what Altman's alleged lack of candor was about. The statement said his behavior was hindering the board's ability to exercise its responsibilities.\nAltman posted Friday on X: 'i loved my time at openai. it was transformative for me personally, and hopefully the world a little bit. most of all i loved working with such talented people. will have more to say about what's next later.'\nThe Associated Press and OpenAI have a\u00a0\nlicensing and technology agreement\n\u00a0allowing OpenAI access to part of the AP's text archives.\nAltman helped start OpenAI as a nonprofit research laboratory in 2015. But it was ChatGPT's explosion into public consciousness that thrust Altman into the spotlight as a face of generative AI \u2014 technology that can produce novel imagery, passages of text and other media. On a world tour this year, he was mobbed by a crowd of adoring fans at an event in London.\nHe's sat with multiple heads of state to discuss AI's potential and perils. Just Thursday, he took part in a\u00a0\nCEO summit\n\u00a0at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference in San Francisco, where OpenAI is based.\nHe predicted AI will prove to be 'the greatest leap forward of any of the big technological revolutions we've had so far.' He also acknowledged the need for guardrails, calling attention to the existential dangers future AI could pose.\nSome computer scientists have criticized that focus on far-off risks as distracting from the real-world limitations and harms of current AI products. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has\u00a0\nlaunched an investigation\n\u00a0into whether OpenAI violated consumer protection laws by scraping public data and publishing false information through its chatbot.\nThe company said its board consists of OpenAI's chief scientist, Ilya Sutskever, and three non-employees: Quora CEO Adam D'Angelo, tech entrepreneur Tasha McCauley, and Helen Toner of the Georgetown Center for Security and Emerging Technology.\nOpenAI's key business partner, Microsoft, which has invested billions of dollars into the startup and helped provide the computing power to run its AI systems, said that the transition won't affect its relationship.\n'We have a long-term partnership with OpenAI and Microsoft remains committed to Mira and their team as we bring this next era of AI to our customers,' said an emailed Microsoft statement.\nWhile not trained as an AI engineer, Altman, now 38, has been seen as a Silicon Valley wunderkind since his early 20s. He was recruited in 2014 to take lead of the startup incubator YCombinator.\n'Sam is one of the smartest people I know, and understands startups better than perhaps anyone I know, including myself,' read YCombinator co-founder Paul Graham's 2014 announcement that Altman would become its president. Graham said at the time that Altman was 'one of those rare people who manage to be both fearsomely effective and yet fundamentally benevolent.'\nOpenAI started out as a nonprofit when it launched with financial backing from Tesla CEO Elon Musk and others. Its stated aims were to 'advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return.'\nThat changed in 2018 when it incorporated a for-profit business Open AI LP, and shifted nearly all its staff into the business, not long after releasing its first generation of the GPT large language model for mimicking human writing. Around the same time, Musk, who had co-chaired its board with Altman, resigned from the board in a move that OpenAI said would eliminate a 'potential future conflict for Elon' due to Tesla's work on building self-driving systems.\nWhile OpenAI's board has preserved its nonprofit governance structure, the startup it oversees has increasingly sought to capitalize on its technology by tailoring its popular chatbot to business customers.\nAt its\u00a0\nfirst developer conference\n\u00a0last week, Altman was the main speaker showcasing a vision for a future of AI agents that could help people with a variety of tasks. Days later, he announced the company would have to pause new subscriptions to its premium version of ChatGPT because it had exceeded capacity.\nAltman's exit 'is indeed shocking as he has been the face of' generative AI technology, said Gartner analyst Arun Chandrasekaran.\nHe said OpenAI still has a 'deep bench of technical leaders' but its next executives will have to steer it through the challenges of scaling the business and meeting the expectations of regulators and society.\nForrester analyst Rowan Curran speculated that Altman's departure, 'while sudden,' did not likely reflect deeper business problems.\n'This seems to be a case of an executive transition that was about issues with the individual in question, and not with the underlying technology or business,' Curran said.\nAltman has a number of possible next steps. Even while running OpenAI, he placed large bets on several other ambitious projects.\nAmong them are Helion Energy, for developing fusion reactors that could produce prodigious amounts of energy from the hydrogen in seawater, and Retro Biosciences, which aims to add 10 years to the human lifespan using biotechnology. Altman also co-founded Worldcoin, a\u00a0\nbiometric and cryptocurrency project\n\u00a0that's been scanning people's eyeballs with the goal of creating a vast digital identity and financial network.\n___\nAssociated Press business writers Haleluya Hadero in New York, Kelvin Chan in London and Michael Liedtke and David Hamilton in San Francisco contributed to this report.\nCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

    "description": "Sam Altman Has Been Fired As Open AI CEO\nPhoto : AP\nIn a statement released on Friday, OpenAI announced the termination of Sam Altman from his role as CEO. The company said the decision was made after a review process found that he \"was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities.\" \nFollowing the news of Altman's departure, attention on social media turned to old tweets from Sam Altman's sister, Annie, where she had previously accused him of abuse. The resurfacing of these tweets sparked speculation among netizens, leading some of them to assume a potential connection between these allegations and Altman's departure from the company.\nRelated News\n\"Sam Altman's sister has made some wild claims in her past posts. Could this have led to his departure?\" one person asked. \n\"Have the allegations of Sam Altman's sister finally caught up with him?\" another asked. \n\"This absolutely screams misconduct unrelated to his job. I don't think the board fires him like this unless he has done something pretty awful. you should google 'sam altman sister allegations,'\" another wrote.\n\"Maybe Sam Altman was fired because he failed to divulge to the board his sister is accusing him of some heinous behavior,\" another user wrote on X.\nIn a series of tweets in 2021, Annie accused her brothers Sam and Jack of subjecting her to abuse while she was a child. \n'I feel strongly that others have also been abused by these perpetrators. I'm seeking people to join me in pursuing legal justice, safety for others in the future, and group healing,\" she wrote at the time.\nNeither Sam Altman nor OpenAI have spoken about the allegations.",

    "description": "(Reuters) -A planned sale of OpenAI employee shares that would value the startup at about $86 billion on paper hangs in the balance after the sudden firing of CEO Sam Altman and a slew of top executive departures, the Information reported on Saturday.\nThe tender offer, which Thrive Capital is leading, has not yet closed but has been in its final stages and was expected to be completed as soon as next month, the report added, citing a person familiar with the matter.\nOpenAI and Thrive Capital did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.\nThe news comes after the board of the company behind ChatGPT fired Altman on Friday.\nGreg Brockman, OpenAI president and co-founder, who stepped down from the board as chairman as part of the management shuffle, quit the company.\nThe departures blindsided many employees who discovered the abrupt management change from an internal message and the company's public facing blog.\nBacked by billions of dollars from Microsoft, which does not have a board seat in the non-profit governing the startup, OpenAI kicked off the generative AI craze last November by releasing ChatGPT.\n(Reporting by Gursimran Kaur in Bengaluru; Editing by Daniel Wallis)",

    "description": "SAN FRANCISCO: Sam Altman, the tech titan behind ChatGPT, was abruptly fired Friday by OpenAI, the company that launched the revolutionary artificial intelligence chatbot.\n\nThe news of his dismissal caught Silicon Valley by surprise, as the 38-year-old had been hailed as a pioneer and one of the leading figures in the high-stakes world of AI.\n\nHe said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that his time at OpenAI had been 'transformative for me personally, and hopefully the world a little bit.'\n\nAltman, together with Tesla chief Elon Musk and others, started OpenAI in 2015, creating a research company with the stated goal of building generative AI that benefits humanity.\n\n'The technological progress we make in the next 100 years will be far larger than all we've made since we first controlled fire and invented the wheel,' Altman said in a 2021 blog post.\n\nStartup guru\n\nBorn in 1985, Altman grew up in a St. Louis suburb, where he got his first computer at the age of eight, according to a profile in the New Yorker from 2016.\n\nComputers and access to an online community helped him navigate being gay in a conservative part of the country, Altman said in an interview with Esquire.\n\nLike so many tech figures before him, Altman dropped out of Stanford University to start a company, Loopt, which let smartphone users selectively share their whereabouts.\n\nLoopt was acquired in 2012 in a deal valued at $43.4 million \u2013 and Altman's place in Silicon Valley was secured.\n\nFearing \u2018pillaging', news outlets block an OpenAI bot\n\nHe took a year off during which he 'read many dozens of textbooks; I learned about the fields that I had been interested in,' the San Francisco resident wrote in a post.\n\nHe told of learning about nuclear engineering, synthetic biology, investing and AI.\n\n'The seeds were planted for things that worked in deep ways later,' he said.\n\nT-shirt and shorts\n\nIn 2014, Altman became president of Y Combinator, an 'accelerator' that provides startups with guidance and funding in exchange for stakes in the young companies.\n\nAltman expanded Y Combinator's strategy for investing beyond software startups to biotech, energy and other fields.\n\n'He thinks quickly and talks quickly; intense, but in a good way,' said Industrial Microbes founder Derek Greenfield, who met Altman while his biotech startup was getting backing from Y Combinator.\n\nGreenfield recalled Altman always dressing casually, sometimes in a T-shirt and shorts.\n\nAltman left Y Combinator, putting his energy into AI despite feared risks.\n\n'He's a very deep thinker who is incredibly focused on getting things right,' Insider Intelligence senior director of marketing and commerce Jeremy Goldman said.\n\nAltman has proposed that combining artificial intelligence, robotics and cost-free energy could essentially enable machines to do all the work and provide a 'basic income' to adults across society.\n\n'A great future isn't complicated: we need technology to create more wealth, and policy to fairly distribute it,' Altman wrote in a blog post.\n\n'Everything necessary will be cheap, and everyone will have enough money to be able to afford it.'\n\n\u2018Fast cars and survival'\n\nIn the New Yorker article, Altman said he was a 'prepper,' someone who has preparations and supplies in place to survive an apocalyptic disaster.\n\nHe has spoken of owning high-performance sports cars and renting planes to fly around California.\n\nAltman said in a blog post that on the last day of each December he writes a list of things he wants to accomplish in the year ahead.\n\nHis personal investments include startups working on fusion energy and human life extension.\n\n'I'm super optimistic,' he said in a podcast with TED curator Chris Anderson.\n\n'It's always easy to doom scroll and think about how bad things are,' Altman added, 'but the good things are really good and getting much better.'\n\nBut Altman has testified before the US Congress and spoken with heads of state about AI as pressure mounts to regulate the technology against risks, such as its potential use in bioweapons and misinformation.\n\nJust hours before being fired on Friday, he told AFP on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in San Francisco that we can't always predict the future.\n\n'The dangerous thing\u2026 it's all the new stuff, the known unknowns, the unknown unknowns that are going to come,' he said.",
